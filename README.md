## floof bot
A GroupMe chatbot that sends pictures of cute, fluffy dogs and cats! Uses the [dog.ceo API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) for getting pictures of dogs and [thecatapi.com](http://thecatapi.com) for pictures of cats. Supports a lot of different dog breeds and sub-breeds ([list](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/breeds-list)).

### Use the floof bot in your own chat
There are a couple steps involved here.
